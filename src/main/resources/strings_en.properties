news.2.title=Forum "Business Awakening 5.0" is postponed to 2021
news.2.description=The organizers of the Business Awakening educational forum announced the postponement of the event from September 26 to next year. This decision was justified by the complex epidemiological situation and the political crisis in Belarus. The general partner of the Business Awakening 5.0 forum in 2021 will be MTBank. “We see what is happening in Belarus now: the focus of society's attention is riveted to the political agenda. The second reason is the inability of foreign speakers to fly to Minsk: borders are closed, quarantine measures are in force in many countries, the world is entering the second wave of coronavirus. The Business Awakening 5.0 Forum will definitely take place as soon as the situation becomes more stable and secure, ”the organizers commented. The line-up of Business Awakening 5.0 speakers will be changed to minimize risks associated with travel restrictions for international speakers. From the previously announced speakers, the businessman, co-owner and director Fedor and cross-marketing expert Vladislav will remain. The organizers apologize for the inconvenience caused by the transfer of the forum. As a gratitude for the loyalty and trust of their clients, they prepared several special bonuses with the support of the general partner of the forum - MTBank. For participants who purchase tickets to the forum with an open date, a number of networking events, gaining knowledge and exchange of experience with expert speakers are planned. Already, every two weeks, the organizers of the "Business Awakening" hold "Master Mind" sessions to help solve real current problems of business in Belarus. “Master Mind” sessions, in addition to networking and knowledge, allow “here and now” to solve a problem in business, work, through organized brainstorms. In addition to speakers, the session also involves experts from different fields (marketing, sales, management). Pre-registration for "Master Mind" is possible in the forum's instagram account. For participants who have already purchased tickets to the forum, the organizers will hold an additional bonus event on October 10 - a one-day MegaPracticum in offline format to develop sales and attract customers.
